                In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who
                you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
                Once you give us your personal information, you are not
                anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are
                required and which fields are optional. You always have the
                option to not provide information by choosing not to use a
                particular service or feature on the Website. We may
                automatically track certain information about you based upon
                your behaviour on our Website.
